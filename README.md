# Debloater Evaluation Dataset


## Introduction
This repository contains the data and artifacts produced as part of our 
evaluation of software debloating tools. This work is currently published for 
reference at the link below. We welcome others to extend/re-use this dataset 
and hope you find it useful in your research / security work. If you use this 
tool in your research, please cite the following paper:
